# Chathippo

A private, fast, local AI chat interface powered by Ollama.

## Short description

Chathippo is a lightweight chat UI that mimics the familiar ChatGPT experience.  
It connects to local Ollama models and keeps all data on the user machine.

## Disclaimer

This project was largely generated with AI. That can introduce code or design issues.  
Because Chathippo runs locally and relies on local models it reduces remote exposure.  
Local execution does not eliminate all risk. Review the code before running. Use caution with sensitive data.

## Features

- Chat with any local Ollama model.
- Local chat history saved on disk.
- Support for system prompts and personalities.
- Clean, minimal UI with light and dark themes.
- Browse a simple model "store".
- Context bar for quick reference.

## Intended audience

Designed for casual users who want a fast, familiar chat interface.  
If you need fine-grained control for production or research use the official Ollama UI or LM Studio.

## Roadmap

Planned items, not guaranteed:
- `llama.cpp` support.
- More built-in personalities.
- A working memory system.
